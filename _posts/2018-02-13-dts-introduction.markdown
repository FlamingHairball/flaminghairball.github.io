I’m building a casual mobile game for iOS and Android.
It’s a pet/hobby/evenings project for me. It’s a side scrolling shooter in the vein of R-Type, Coryoon, and Jetpack Joyride.
The game will either be self-published and guerilla-marketed (a learning process) or potentially partner with a Bay Area publisher.

Right now I’m a 1-man team as I lay the gameplay and analysis framework — once the gameplay is solid I’ll likely contract a 3D and UI artist to round out the rough edges.

I have three goals:
1. Make a fun game!
2. To learn-by-doing out-game tasks - user acquisition, campaigns, data analysis and segmentation. My background and skillset is primarily technical -- I want to build and improve a skillset in game design and iteration.
3. Experiment with technologies I’m interested in but don’t necessarily have an outlet for in my day job

Development of the game will be as transparent as I have time to make. Specifically, I'm far more interested in writing about the process of iterating through bad solutions to get to the good than simply reading a retrospective of good solutions -- in that spirit, I hope that this blog will fill with many examples of things NOT to do before we get to the ones that actually work.

This is what the game looks like right now:

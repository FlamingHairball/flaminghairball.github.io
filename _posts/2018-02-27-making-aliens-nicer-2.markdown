Yesterday I made the alien cruisers a little nicer by making them vary their speed slightly to add some noise to their pattern.
This introduced a problem where one alien cruiser can spawn in the same lane as another, but move at a slower speed than the one behind, causing them to collide mid-screen, as in the top lane here:

I will fix this by not allowing an obstacle to spawn in a lane thatâ€™s already occupied by an obstacle.

This is the result:

A little better but highlights a problem with the spawner -- after destroying an enemy in a lane, there can be a quite significant (in rapid gameplay time) delay before the lane is occupied with another enemy.
